# ListBug

SidebarListStyle on macOS mixes up items in the sidebar list. DefaultListStyle behaves correctly on macOS and iOS.

Run the project. The first table section should have items "Thing 0", "Thing 1"...up to "Thing 4". The second section should have items "Item 6", "Item 7",... up to "Item 9".
